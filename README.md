# preinstall-utils

A common Go library with some helper functions used before installing OCP operating systems to disk. At the moment it's used to share similar disk cleanup code between the [Assisted Installer](https://github.com/openshift/assisted-installer/) and the [Lifecycle Agent](https://github.com/openshift-kni/lifecycle-agent/) projects.
